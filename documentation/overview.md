# Open Source Brainstorm App Overview

**What is this app?**

Open Source Brainstorm is an AI-powered platform designed to help students and developers discover the perfect open source projects to fork and enhance. Unlike traditional project catalogs, it uses artificial intelligence to understand each user's interests, skills, and goals, then recommends highly relevant, forkable projects while automatically filtering out unsuitable repositories like learning resources, frameworks, and meta-repositories.

The platform focuses on matching users with actual applications and tools they can meaningfully contribute to, making it ideal for academic assignments and personal portfolio development.
