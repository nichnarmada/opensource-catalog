# Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern web technology stack to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable application. Below is an overview of the key technologies used:

---

## Frontend

- **Next.js**  
  A React framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making it ideal for building fast, SEO-friendly web applications.

- **TypeScript**  
  A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity by catching errors during development.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates UI development with pre-defined classes. It provides a highly customizable and responsive design system.

- **shadcn/ui**  
  A component library built to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-designed, customizable components that speed up the development process while maintaining a consistent design language.

- **Vercel**  
  A platform optimized for Next.js deployments, offering features like serverless functions, continuous integration, and automatic deployments.

- **pnpm**  
  A fast, disk space efficient package manager that is used to manage the project's dependencies.

- **ESLint & Prettier**  
  Tools for maintaining consistent code style and quality through linting and formatting.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control (Git) and repository hosting (GitHub) for managing and collaborating on the project codebase.
