This project leverages a modern web technology stack to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable application. Below is an overview of the key technologies used:

---

## Frontend

- **Next.js**A React framework that supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), making it ideal for building fast, SEO-friendly web applications.
- **TypeScript**A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity by catching errors during development.
- **Tailwind CSS**A utility-first CSS framework that accelerates UI development with pre-defined classes. It provides a highly customizable and responsive design system.
- **shadcn/ui**
  A component library built to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-designed, customizable components that speed up the development process while maintaining a consistent design language.

## Backend & Services

- **Firebase**A comprehensive app development platform by Google. In this project, Firebase is used for:

  - **Firebase Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization.
  - **Firebase Firestore:** A NoSQL document database for storing and syncing app data in real time.
    - User profiles and preferences
    - Project recommendations
    - Bookmarks and interactions
  - **Firebase Functions:** For implementing serverless backend logic and AI integration.
  - **Firebase Hosting:** Fast and secure hosting for web applications.

- **AI Services**

  - **OpenAI API:** For generating project recommendations and analyzing user preferences.
